📖 Description:

VectorDB Builder is a lightweight semantic search project that integrates Sentence Transformers with Chroma, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of text embeddings.
It uses the HKU NLP Instructor model (hkunlp/instructor-base) to generate high-quality sentence embeddings and stores them in a Chroma vector database for similarity search.
This setup forms the foundation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), context-based AI applications, and intelligent search systems by comparing semantic meaning rather than exact keywords.

⚙️ Features:

🧠 Generates embeddings using SentenceTransformer (Instructor model)

💾 Stores and manages vectors using ChromaDB

🔍 Performs semantic similarity search between query and stored texts

⚙️ Implements custom embedding wrapper for LangChain compatibility

⚡ Lightweight, local, and easily extendable for RAG or chatbot projects

🧠 Tech Stack:

Language: Python

Libraries: Sentence-Transformers, LangChain, ChromaDB

Model: hkunlp/instructor-base

Purpose: Embedding generation, vector storage, and semantic retrieval

🚀 Outcome:

Developed a functional vector-based semantic search system that demonstrates how embeddings can be leveraged for context-aware AI applications like document retrieval and intelligent assistants.
